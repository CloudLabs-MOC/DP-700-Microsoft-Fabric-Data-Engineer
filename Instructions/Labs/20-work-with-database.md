# Work with SQL Database in Microsoft Fabric

SQL database in Microsoft Fabric is a developer-friendly transactional database, based on Azure SQL Database, that allow you to easily create your operational database in Fabric. A SQL database in Fabric uses the SQL Database engine as Azure SQL Database.

This lab will take approximately **30** minutes to complete.

> **Note**: You need a [Microsoft Fabric trial](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial) to complete this exercise.

## Create a workspace

Before working with data in Fabric, create a workspace with the Fabric trial enabled.

1. On the [Microsoft Fabric home page](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/home?experience=fabric) at `https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/home?experience=fabric`, select **Synapse Data Warehouse**.
1. In the menu bar on the left, select **Workspaces** (the icon looks similar to &#128455;).
1. Create a new workspace with a name of your choice, selecting a licensing mode that includes Fabric capacity (*Trial*, *Premium*, or *Fabric*).
1. When your new workspace opens, it should be empty.

## Create a SQL database with sample data

Now that you have a workspace, it's time to create a SQL database.

1. On the left panel, select **+ Create**.
1. Navigate to the **Databases** section, and select **SQL Database**.
1. Enter **AdventureWorksLT** as the database name, and select **Create**.
1. Once you have created your database, you can load sample data into your database from **Sample data** card.

    After a minute or so, your database will be populated with sample data for your scenario.

## Query a SQL database

The SQL query editor provides support for IntelliSense, code completion, syntax highlighting, client-side parsing, and validation. You can run Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML) and Data Control Language (DCL) statements.

1. In the **AdventureWorksLT** database page, navigate to **Home**, and select **New query**.

1. In the new blank query pane, enter and run the following T-SQL code.

    ```sql
    SELECT 
        p.Name AS ProductName,
        pc.Name AS CategoryName,
        p.ListPrice
    FROM 
        SalesLT.Product p
    INNER JOIN 
        SalesLT.ProductCategory pc ON p.ProductCategoryID = pc.ProductCategoryID
    ORDER BY 
    p.ListPrice DESC;
    ```
    
    This query joins the `Product` and `ProductCategory` tables to display the product names, their categories, and their list prices, sorted by price in descending order.

1. In a new query editor, enter and run the following T-SQL code.

    ```sql
   SELECT 
        c.FirstName,
        c.LastName,
        soh.OrderDate,
        soh.SubTotal
    FROM 
        SalesLT.Customer c
    INNER JOIN 
        SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader soh ON c.CustomerID = soh.CustomerID
    ORDER BY 
        soh.OrderDate DESC;
    ```

    This query retrieves a list of customers along with their order dates and subtotals, sorted by the order date in descending order. 

1. Close all query tabs.

## Integrate data with external data sources

You will integrate an external data about public holidays with sales order. Then, you'll  identify sales orders that coincide with public holidays, providing insights into how holidays might impact sales activities.

1. Navigate to **Home**, and select **New query**.

1. In the new blank query pane, enter and run the following T-SQL code.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE SalesLT.PublicHolidays (
        CountryOrRegion NVARCHAR(50),
        HolidayName NVARCHAR(100),
        Date DATE,
        IsPaidTimeOff BIT
    );
    ```

    This query creates the `SalesLT.PublicHolidays` table in preparation to the next step.

1. In a new query editor, enter and run the following T-SQL code.

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO SalesLT.PublicHolidays (CountryOrRegion, HolidayName, Date, IsPaidTimeOff)
    SELECT CountryOrRegion, HolidayName, Date, IsPaidTimeOff
    FROM OPENROWSET 
    (BULK 'abs://holidaydatacontainer@azureopendatastorage.blob.core.windows.net/Processed/*.parquet'
    , FORMAT = 'PARQUET') AS [PublicHolidays]
    WHERE countryorRegion in ('Canada', 'United Kingdom', 'United States')
        AND YEAR([date]) = 2024
    ```
    
    This query reads holiday data from Parquet files in Azure Blob Storage, filters it to include only holidays in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States for the year 2024, and then inserts this filtered data into the `SalesLT.PublicHolidays` table.    

1. In a new or existing query editor, enter and execute the following T-SQL code.

    ```sql
    -- Insert new addresses into SalesLT.Address
    INSERT INTO SalesLT.Address (AddressLine1, City, StateProvince, CountryRegion, PostalCode, rowguid, ModifiedDate)
    VALUES
        ('123 Main St', 'Seattle', 'WA', 'United States', '98101', NEWID(), GETDATE()),
        ('456 Maple Ave', 'Toronto', 'ON', 'Canada', 'M5H 2N2', NEWID(), GETDATE()),
        ('789 Oak St', 'London', 'England', 'United Kingdom', 'EC1A 1BB', NEWID(), GETDATE());
    
    -- Insert new orders into SalesOrderHeader
    INSERT INTO SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader (
        SalesOrderID, RevisionNumber, OrderDate, DueDate, ShipDate, Status, OnlineOrderFlag, 
        PurchaseOrderNumber, AccountNumber, CustomerID, ShipToAddressID, BillToAddressID, 
        ShipMethod, CreditCardApprovalCode, SubTotal, TaxAmt, Freight, Comment, rowguid, ModifiedDate
    )
    VALUES
        (1001, 1, '2024-12-25', '2024-12-30', '2024-12-26', 1, 1, 'PO12345', 'AN123', 1, (SELECT TOP 1 AddressID FROM SalesLT.Address WHERE AddressLine1 = '789 Oak St'), (SELECT TOP 1 AddressID FROM SalesLT.Address WHERE AddressLine1 = '123 Main St'), 'Ground', '12345', 100.00, 10.00, 5.00, 'New Order 1', NEWID(), GETDATE()),
        (1002, 1, '2024-11-28', '2024-12-03', '2024-11-29', 1, 1, 'PO67890', 'AN456', 2, (SELECT TOP 1 AddressID FROM SalesLT.Address WHERE AddressLine1 = '123 Main St'), (SELECT TOP 1 AddressID FROM SalesLT.Address WHERE AddressLine1 = '456 Maple Ave'), 'Air', '67890', 200.00, 20.00, 10.00, 'New Order 2', NEWID(), GETDATE()),
        (1003, 1, '2024-02-19', '2024-02-24', '2024-02-20', 1, 1, 'PO54321', 'AN789', 3, (SELECT TOP 1 AddressID FROM SalesLT.Address WHERE AddressLine1 = '456 Maple Ave'), (SELECT TOP 1 AddressID FROM SalesLT.Address WHERE AddressLine1 = '789 Oak St'), 'Sea', '54321', 300.00, 30.00, 15.00, 'New Order 3', NEWID(), GETDATE()),
        (1004, 1, '2024-05-27', '2024-06-01', '2024-05-28', 1, 1, 'PO98765', 'AN321', 4, (SELECT TOP 1 AddressID FROM SalesLT.Address WHERE AddressLine1 = '789 Oak St'), (SELECT TOP 1 AddressID FROM SalesLT.Address WHERE AddressLine1 = '789 Oak St'), 'Ground', '98765', 400.00, 40.00, 20.00, 'New Order 4', NEWID(), GETDATE());
    ```

    This code adds new addresses and orders to the database, simulating fictitious orders from different countries.

1. In a new or existing query editor, enter and execute the following T-SQL code.

    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT soh.SalesOrderID, soh.OrderDate, ph.HolidayName, ph.CountryOrRegion
    FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS soh
    INNER JOIN SalesLT.Address a
        ON a.AddressID = soh.ShipToAddressID
    INNER JOIN SalesLT.PublicHolidays AS ph
        ON soh.OrderDate = ph.Date AND a.CountryRegion = ph.CountryOrRegion
    ```

    Take a moment to observe the results, noting how the query identifies sales orders that coincide with public holidays in the respective countries. This can provide valuable insights into order patterns and potential impacts of holidays on sales activities.

1. Close all query tabs.

## Secure data

Suppose a specific group of users should only have access to data from the United States to generate reports.

Let's create a view based on the query we used earlier, and add a filter to it.

1. In the new blank query pane, enter and run the following T-SQL code.

    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW SalesLT.vw_SalesOrderHoliday AS
    SELECT DISTINCT soh.SalesOrderID, soh.OrderDate, ph.HolidayName, ph.CountryOrRegion
    FROM SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS soh
    INNER JOIN SalesLT.Address a
        ON a.AddressID = soh.ShipToAddressID
    INNER JOIN SalesLT.PublicHolidays AS ph
        ON soh.OrderDate = ph.Date AND a.CountryRegion = ph.CountryOrRegion
    WHERE a.CountryRegion = 'United Kingdom';
    ```

1. In a new or existing query editor, enter and execute the following T-SQL code.

    ```sql
    -- Create the role
    CREATE ROLE SalesOrderRole;
    
    -- Grant select permission on the view to the role
    GRANT SELECT ON SalesLT.vw_SalesOrderHoliday TO SalesOrderRole;
    ```

    Any user added as a member to the `SalesOrderRole` role will have access only to the filtered view. If a user in this role attempts to access any other user objects, they will receive an error message similar to this:

    ```
    Msg 229, Level 14, State 5, Line 1
    The SELECT permission was denied on the object 'ObjectName', database 'DatabaseName', schema 'SchemaName'.
    ```
