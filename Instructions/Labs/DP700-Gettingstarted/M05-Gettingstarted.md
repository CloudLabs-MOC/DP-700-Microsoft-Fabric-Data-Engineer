# DP-700: Microsoft-Fabric-Data-Engineer Workshop

Welcome to your DP-700: Microsoft-Fabric-Data-Engineer Workshop! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn Azure Services. Let's begin by making the most of this experience.

### Overall Estimated timing: 2 hr 30 minutes

In this hands-on lab, you'll explore key administrative and operational features of Microsoft Fabric. You'll begin by monitoring activities across various Fabric artifacts—such as lakehouses, dataflows, and notebooks—using the centralized monitoring hub. Then, you'll learn how to secure data access at multiple levels using workspace permissions, item-level controls, and OneLake data access roles. Finally, you'll implement deployment pipelines to automate and manage content promotion across Development, Test, and Production environments. By the end, you'll gain practical experience in monitoring, securing, and operationalizing solutions in Microsoft Fabric.


## Objectives

By the end of this lab series, you will be able to monitor activity in Microsoft Fabric using the monitoring hub, secure data access with multi-layer permissions, and implement deployment pipelines to manage content across development, test, and production environments.

1. **Monitor Fabric activity in the monitoring hub**: You will learn how to monitor activities in Microsoft Fabric using the monitoring hub, track execution history of artifacts like lakehouses, dataflows, and notebooks, and customize views to manage large volumes of activity logs effectively.

1. **Secure data access in Microsoft Fabric**: You will learn how to secure data access in Microsoft Fabric by applying workspace access controls, item-level permissions, and OneLake data access roles. This lab will guide you through configuring security at multiple levels to protect sensitive data and control access within Data Warehouses and Lakehouses.

1. **Implement deployment pipelines in Microsoft Fabric**: You will learn how to implement deployment pipelines in Microsoft Fabric to automate the promotion of content across different environments like Development, Test, and Production. This lab will guide you through creating workspaces, configuring deployment pipelines, and managing content across stages for streamlined content validation and deployment.


## Pre-requisites

- Basic understanding of Microsoft Fabric architecture and core components like lakehouses, dataflows, and notebooks
- Familiarity with workspace and item-level access controls in cloud-based data platforms
- General knowledge of CI/CD concepts and deployment workflows

## Architecture

In this hands-on lab, the architecture flow includes several essential components.

1. **Monitor Fabric Activity in the Monitoring Hub**:
This involves using the Monitoring Hub in Microsoft Fabric to track and manage the execution of lakehouses, dataflows, notebooks, and other artifacts. The architecture focuses on centralized activity logging, enabling users to customize views and efficiently monitor large volumes of operational data.

1. **Secure Data Access in Microsoft Fabric**:
This focuses on applying multiple layers of security, including workspace access controls, item-level permissions, and OneLake data access roles to protect sensitive data. The architecture demonstrates how permissions are enforced across lakehouses, data warehouses, and other components to control access effectively.

1. **Implement Deployment Pipelines in Microsoft Fabric**:
This highlights automating content promotion across Development, Test, and Production environments using deployment pipelines. The architecture illustrates workspace separation for each environment, content flow through various stages, and version management to ensure streamlined validation and deployment processes.

## Explanation of Components

1. **Monitoring Hub**: A centralized dashboard in Microsoft Fabric that provides detailed logs and activity insights for artifacts like notebooks, pipelines, and dataflows, helping users track executions and troubleshoot issues efficiently.

1. **Workspace Access Controls**: Security settings that manage user permissions at the workspace level, allowing administrators to define roles and control access to shared resources.

1. **Deployment Pipelines**: A structured mechanism to automate content promotion across Development, Test, and Production stages, ensuring governance, version control, and streamlined validation of updates in Microsoft Fabric.
