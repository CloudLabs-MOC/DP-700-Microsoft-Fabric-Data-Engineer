# DP-700: Microsoft-Fabric-Data-Engineer Workshop

Welcome to your DP-700: Microsoft-Fabric-Data-Engineer Workshop! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn Azure Services. Let's begin by making the most of this experience.

### Overall Estimated timing: 2 hr 30 minutes

In this hands-on lab, you'll explore key administrative and operational features of Microsoft Fabric. You'll begin by monitoring activities across various Fabric artifacts—such as lakehouses, dataflows, and notebooks—using the centralized monitoring hub. Then, you'll learn how to secure data access at multiple levels using workspace permissions, item-level controls, and OneLake data access roles. Finally, you'll implement deployment pipelines to automate and manage content promotion across Development, Test, and Production environments. By the end, you'll gain practical experience in monitoring, securing, and operationalizing solutions in Microsoft Fabric.


## Objectives

By the end of this lab series, you will be able to monitor activity in Microsoft Fabric using the monitoring hub, secure data access with multi-layer permissions, and implement deployment pipelines to manage content across development, test, and production environments.

1. **Monitor Fabric activity in the monitoring hub**: You will learn how to monitor activities in Microsoft Fabric using the monitoring hub, track execution history of artifacts like lakehouses, dataflows, and notebooks, and customize views to manage large volumes of activity logs effectively.

1. **Secure data access in Microsoft Fabric**: You will learn how to secure data access in Microsoft Fabric by applying workspace access controls, item-level permissions, and OneLake data access roles. This lab will guide you through configuring security at multiple levels to protect sensitive data and control access within Data Warehouses and Lakehouses.

1. **Implement deployment pipelines in Microsoft Fabric**: You will learn how to implement deployment pipelines in Microsoft Fabric to automate the promotion of content across different environments like Development, Test, and Production. This lab will guide you through creating workspaces, configuring deployment pipelines, and managing content across stages for streamlined content validation and deployment.


## Pre-requisites

- Basic understanding of Microsoft Fabric architecture and core components like lakehouses, dataflows, and notebooks
- Familiarity with workspace and item-level access controls in cloud-based data platforms
- General knowledge of CI/CD concepts and deployment workflows
