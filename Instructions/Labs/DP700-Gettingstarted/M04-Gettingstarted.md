# DP-700: Microsoft-Fabric-Data-Engineer Workshop

Welcome to your DP-700: Microsoft-Fabric-Data-Engineer Workshop! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn Azure Services. Let's begin by making the most of this experience.

### Overall Estimated timing: 4 hrs

In this hands-on lab, you'll explore core and advanced concepts of data warehousing using Microsoft Fabric. You'll begin by creating and loading data into a Fabric data warehouse using T-SQL, and then query and analyze the data using built-in SQL tools. You'll also monitor performance using dynamic management views and query insights. Finally, you'll implement security measures like dynamic data masking, row-level, and column-level security to protect sensitive information and manage access effectively. By the end, you'll have practical experience building, managing, and securing a modern data warehouse in Microsoft Fabric.


## Objectives

By the end of this lab series, you will be able to create, manage, and secure a Microsoft Fabric data warehouse, load and query data using T-SQL, monitor performance, and implement advanced security for enterprise-scale analytics.

1. **Analyze data in a data warehouse**: You will learn how to create a data warehouse in Microsoft Fabric that supports large-scale analytics with full SQL capabilities. This lab will guide you through defining tables, building a relational model, running queries, and visualizing results through integrated reports.

1. **Load data into a warehouse using T-SQL**: You will learn how to load data into a Microsoft Fabric data warehouse using T-SQL for scalable analytics. This lab walks you through creating a lakehouse, defining tables, and using stored procedures to populate and validate a structured data warehouse.

1. **Query a data warehouse in Microsoft Fabric**: You will learn how to query a data warehouse in Microsoft Fabric using T-SQL to explore and validate data. This lab guides you through creating a warehouse, running analytical queries, and building filtered views for reporting in a high-performance environment.

1. **Monitor a data warehouse in Microsoft Fabric**: You will learn how to monitor a data warehouse in Microsoft Fabric using dynamic management views (DMVs) and query insights. This lab will guide you through tracking current activity and analyzing historical performance to ensure efficient query execution and system health.

1. **Secure a Microsoft Fabric data warehouse**: You will learn how to secure a Microsoft Fabric data warehouse by implementing dynamic data masking, row-level and column-level security, and granular SQL permissions. This lab will help you protect sensitive data and manage user access effectively within your data environment.


## Pre-requisites

- Basic understanding of data warehousing concepts and relational database design
- Familiarity with writing and executing T-SQL queries
- General knowledge of data loading, transformation, and reporting workflows

## Architecture

In this hands-on lab, the architecture flow includes several essential components.

1. **Analyze data in a data warehouse**: Understanding how data flows from structured sources into a Microsoft Fabric data warehouse for analysis. The architecture includes SQL-based compute engines, relational models for structured queries, and Power BI integration for visualizing insights directly from warehouse tables.

1. **Load data into a warehouse using T-SQL**:
Illustrates a pipeline where data is ingested from a lakehouse into a warehouse using T-SQL. The ARC diagram includes the lakehouse as a staging layer, SQL stored procedures for data transformation, and data warehouse tables for structured analytics and reporting.

1. **Query a data warehouse in Microsoft Fabric**:
Focusing on high-performance querying within a Fabric warehouse, this diagram shows the interaction between end-users (via Power BI or SQL tools), optimized query execution engines, and pre-modeled warehouse tables or views designed for analytical exploration.

1. **Monitor a data warehouse in Microsoft Fabric**:
Depicting a monitoring and diagnostics workflow using DMVs and telemetry streams. The architecture includes Fabric's monitoring services, logs generated by SQL activity, and dashboards or tools (like Log Analytics) to track performance and troubleshoot workloads.

1. **Secure a Microsoft Fabric data warehouse**:
Highlighting the security layers across the warehouse architecture, including data masking at the query layer, row-level and column-level security at the storage engine, and role-based access controls managed via Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) for identity governance.

## Explanation of Components

1. **Fabric Data Warehouse**: A centralized, scalable storage system in Microsoft Fabric optimized for structured analytics, offering full SQL capabilities and integration with Power BI for business intelligence.

1. **T-SQL (Transact-SQL)**: The primary query language used in Microsoft Fabric for managing and manipulating data in warehouses, supporting stored procedures, batch loading, and complex analytics.

1. **Dynamic Management Views (DMVs)**: Built-in system views in Fabric that provide insights into query performance, user activity, and resource usage for warehouse monitoring and optimization.

1. **Dynamic Data Masking**: A feature that hides sensitive information in query results without altering the underlying data, helping secure data access for non-privileged users.
